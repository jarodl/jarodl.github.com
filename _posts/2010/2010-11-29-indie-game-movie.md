If for some reason you haven't heard anything about "Indie Game: The Movie":http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/, check out their latest video interview with [Derek Yu](http://www.derekyu.com/), creator of [Spelunky](http://spelunkyworld.com/). The creators of the film, James Swirsky and Lisanne Pajot, have been putting out these amazing clips for the past six months or so. The production quality is incredible and hearing the story of each game developer is really motivational.

_Just in case you need an extra boost of knowledge/awesome/inspiration, check out Derek Yu's blog 'Make Games'. [This post is especially fantastic](http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game)._
