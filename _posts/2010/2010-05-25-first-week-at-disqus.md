I arrived to San Francisco about a week ago to start my internship with [Disqus](http://disqus.com). I would love to look back on this summer in the future, so I will be keeping short records of my experiences.

#### Living in San Francisco

It's a big change. The tech scene in this city is amazing (which is a given) and it's a beautiful place to visit. I don't think I would ever want to live here permanently, but it could definitely be a fun place to live in short periods. The main reason for this (for me anyway) is due to the gangs of homeless crazy people roaming the sidewalks twenty-four-seven. Even if they do yell out quotes from 300, It's just not something I like seeing every morning and every night walking home from work.

#### Working for Disqus

I knew it was going to be exciting and that I would enjoy the work, but the experience has been nothing but awesome. The work environment is really casual and the guys I work with are great. This past weekend we even went paintball'ing, which was a blast. I'm so thankful for this opportunity. When you are surrounded by cool people and are doing the things you love, it stops feeling like work and turns into pure fun.

#### Python and Django

I have been doing Ruby and Ruby on Rails work for about a year and a half now. While my relationship with Rails is not as strong as it used to be, I still love programming in Ruby. I have been curious about Python for a long time, but never really took the time to dive into it. Since Disqus is one of the largest Django apps on the web, I had the chance to learn more about the framework this week while working on my first project. I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Working with Django was painless and the documentation is amazing. I'm really excited about learning more about both topics (and hopefully learning more JavaScript along the way, since that is also a big part of Disqus).
