title: St. Louis Hackathon

This Saturday, December 4th, two events are taking place worldwide that I would love to be involved in. One being [Open Data Day](http://www.opendataday.org/) and the other [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/). I was pretty disappointed when there was not an event planned for St. Louis so I figured I would take the initiative. This is very last minute so if anyone would like to help organize feel free.

#### Event Details

Register and find out more on [Eventbrite](http://rhokstlouis.eventbrite.com/).

#### Location

The only place that came to mind for doing something like this in St. Louis was a coffee shop. [Coffee Cartel](http://thecoffeecartel.com/) is open for 24 hours but might be limited in space. I'm going to contact them to see if we could make it official or something but until then suggestions are welcome.
