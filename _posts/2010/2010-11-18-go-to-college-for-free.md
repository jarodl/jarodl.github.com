For the majority of my life I have wanted a career in the software industry so the natural thing to do fresh out of high school was to get a degree in Computer Science. If I could talk to my eighteen-year-old self I might advise a different route. Going to school can be extremely expensive and with today's resources seems unnecessary if you are self-motivated and passionate about achieving your goals. I'm definitely not the first person to think of this and I'm not sure I would have had the guts to do it but I thought it would be interesting to see what a completely free Computer Science curriculum would look like.

_Note: I'm not claiming to be an expert in Computer Science or Education, this is just similar to the curriculum I went through as a Computer Science major. Also, there are quite a few courses listed that I have not watched but were highly rated, if there is a better option out there please speak up in the comments!_

h4. First year

The MIT course introduces Computer Science and Programming using the Python programming language.

"MIT: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming":http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=341597455%20

The first Stanford class uses Java then moves to C++ in the second one.

h4. Finally

Pretty crazy that you can learn all of this while sitting at home in your pajamas. For free. It would take a lot of work and some pretty understanding parents to let you sit at home all day but I still think it's interesting that you don't hear about a lot of people doing this (or at least I don't).
