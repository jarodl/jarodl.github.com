				<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect' title='Overjustification effect'>overjustification effect</a> is when an external incentive decreases motivation to perform a task. External incentives have been used in places like acadamia for a long time but have recently grown extremely popular in video games. It is rare to play a game that does not reward the player with some type of achievement or point system.</p>

<p>External incentives work great for tasks that are boring and unfulfilling. Few people clean or do chores because they find it rewarding and fun, they are performed out of necessity or for money. If a game is fun and enjoyable the player should not need any additional motivation. Playing a game to unlock achievements sucks out the fun.</p>

<p>Instead of meaningless rewards and points, games should focus on giving positive reinforcement and data on a player’s level of expertise. Simply telling a player ‘good job’ is a good boost of motivation without shifting the player’s focus towards obtaining a reward. Attaching points to performance data like accuracy, completion or speed is <a href='http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627' title='A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation'>detrimental</a>. Measuring competence without attaching points or rewards is enough to enhance intrisic motivation.</p>

<p>Enjoying the task at hand should be a game’s number one priority.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="post_content">
			
				
				<p>Bumpy Road is a title for iOS that deserves great praise for its art direction, music and polished feel but has much more potential than the average play that it delivers. The player controls the momentum of the car by sliding his finger left and right on the screen and creating a bump. Points are awarded for how long you can keep the car filled up with fuel by collecting “gizmos” found along the road.</p>

<p>The pacing of the game is fairly strict since the screen moves at a constant rate. Once the player builds up speed he is stopped quickly by the right side of the screen. This is unfortunate because the mechanic is so much fun to use. Sliding up the piano-like tiles of the screen has a great animation and begs the player to do one fluid swipe with the expectation that this will jet the car forward. After collecting enough gizmos the screen movement does speed up and stays as long as the fuel meter stays above the half-way mark, but this is often short lived (or I’m not very good).</p>

<p>The overall visual metaphor feels conflicted with the main game mechanic. In one game mode, Sunday Drive, reaching the end of the road in the least amount of time is the main objective. Restricting the player to the speed that the screen moves feels counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Remove the speed restriction placed by controlling the screen movement and I would play this game all of the time. The game mechanic of Bumpy Road has a huge potential to create a flowing movement that gives a great sense of speed similar to games like Tiny Wings and Canabalt. With the amount of incredible work put in to the artwork, music, performance and game menus I have no doubt that it could compete well with either.</p>

<h4 id='closing'>Closing</h4>

<p>I would like to follow this ‘review’ up with a quote from one of my favorite movies</p>

<pre><code>in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so</code></pre>

<p>Not to say that Bumpy Road is even close to being a piece of junk. I have a great respect for anyone who creates something and puts it out in the world, so kudos to <a href='http://www.simogo.com/'>Simogo</a>, they have made something beautiful.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="post_content">
			
				
				<p>When starting a new universal iOS OpenGL project I usually select the &#8216;Window-based Application&#8217; template and then copy over the files from the &#8216;OpenGL ES Application&#8217; template. After doing this a few warnings show up regarding the OpenGL ES 2.0 shader files.</p>

<pre><code>warning: no rule to process file &#39;$(PROJECT_DIR)/Shader.fsh&#39; of type sourcecode.glsl for architecture i386
warning: no rule to process file &#39;$(PROJECT_DIR)/Shader.vsh&#39; of type sourcecode.glsl for architecture i386</code></pre>

<p>I noticed a few other people having this issue on <a href='http://inkubator.idevgames.com/forums/thread-397.html'>idevgames.com</a> and <a href='http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-game-development/39349-opengl-es-shader-bug-only-iphone-3gs.html'>iphonedevsdk.com</a> so here is how to fix it.</p>

<p>When you add the two shader files (Shader.fsh and Shader.vsh) add them to the application target. After they are copied into your project click the dropdown arrow next to the application target in the Targets folder of the group tree. You will see three folders. If you are getting the above warnings the shader files are probably in the &#8216;Compile Sources&#8217; folder. Move them to the &#8216;Copy Bundle Resources&#8217; folder and the warning should go away.</p>

<p>Make sure both dates are translated to the correct time zone. If you start seeing wrong values (&#8220;this was posted -4 hours ago!&#8221;) then that&#8217;s probably what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<pre><code>// set the time zone of the date value used
[dateFormatter setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation:@&quot;GMT&quot;]];

// To set the time zone of the calendar that we use to get the elapsed time, do this:
NSCalendar *cal = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
[cal setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone localTimeZone]];
NSDateComponents *elapsedTime = [cal components:desiredComponents fromDate:fromDate toDate:[NSDate date] options:0];</code></pre>

One being <a href='http://www.opendataday.org/'>Open Data Day</a> and the other <a href='http://www.rhok.org/'>Random Hacks of Kindness</a>. I was pretty disappointed when there was not an event planned for St. Louis so I figured I would take the initiative. This is very last minute so if anyone would like to help organize feel free.</p>

<p>The only place that came to mind for doing something like this in St. Louis was a coffee shop. <a href='http://thecoffeecartel.com/'>Coffee Cartel</a> is open for 24 hours but might be limited in space. I&#8217;m going to contact them to see if we could make it official or something but until then suggestions are welcome.</p>

				<p>For the majority of my life I have wanted a career in the software industry so the natural thing to do fresh out of high school was to get a degree in Computer Science. If I could talk to my eighteen-year-old self I might advise a different route. Going to school can be extremely expensive and with today&#8217;s resources seems unnecessary if you are self-motivated and passionate about achieving your goals. I&#8217;m definitely not the first person to think of this and I&#8217;m not sure I would have had the guts to do it but I thought it would be interesting to see what a completely free Computer Science curriculum would look like.</p>

<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not claiming to be an expert in Computer Science or Education, this is just similar to the curriculum I went through as a Computer Science major. Also, there are quite a few courses listed that I have not watched but were highly rated, if there is a better option out there please speak up in the comments!</em></p>

<p>h4. First year</p>

<p>The MIT course introduces Computer Science and Programming using the Python programming language.</p>

<p>&#8220;MIT: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=341597455%20</p>

<p>The first Stanford class uses Java then moves to C++ in the second one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Programming Methodology&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/programming-methodology/id384232896 &#8220;Stanford: Programming Abstractions&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/programming-abstractions/id384232917 &#8220;MIT: Single Variable Calculus&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/single-variable-calculus/id354869053 &#8220;MIT: Multivariable Calculus&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/multivariable-calculus-spring/id354869122 &#8220;MIT: Introduction to Psychology&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=341596834</p>

<p>h4. Second year</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Programming Paradigms&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=384233005%20 &#8220;Stanford: Human Computer Interaction&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id384230293 &#8220;MIT: Linear Algebra&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id384230293 &#8220;UC Berkeley: Statistics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=391540415 &#8220;Oxford: Critical Reasoning&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/critical-reasoning-for-beginners/id387875756</p>

<p>h4. Third year</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Machine Learning&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/machine-learning/id384233048 &#8220;Stanford: Introduction to Robotics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/introduction-to-robotics/id384233063 &#8220;Stanford: Developing Apps for iOS&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=395631522 &#8220;Github - find or start a project to contribute to&#8221;:https://github.com/ &#8220;MIT: Physics - Classical Mechanics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/physics-i-classical-mechanics/id341599916</p>

<p>h4. Fourth year</p>

<p>&#8220;MIT: Introduction to Algorithms&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/introduction-to-algorithms/id341597754 &#8220;Github - find or start a project to contribute to&#8221;:https://github.com/</p>

<p>h4. Finally</p>

<p>Pretty crazy that you can learn all of this while sitting at home in your pajamas. For free. It would take a lot of work and some pretty understanding parents to let you sit at home all day but I still think it&#8217;s interesting that you don&#8217;t hear about a lot of people doing this (or at least I don&#8217;t).</p>
