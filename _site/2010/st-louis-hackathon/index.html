			<p>This Saturday, December 4th, two events are taking place worldwide that I would love to be involved in. One being <a href='http://www.opendataday.org/'>Open Data Day</a> and the other <a href='http://www.rhok.org/'>Random Hacks of Kindness</a>. I was pretty disappointed when there was not an event planned for St. Louis so I figured I would take the initiative. This is very last minute so if anyone would like to help organize feel free.</p>

<p>The only place that came to mind for doing something like this in St. Louis was a coffee shop. <a href='http://thecoffeecartel.com/'>Coffee Cartel</a> is open for 24 hours but might be limited in space. I&#8217;m going to contact them to see if we could make it official or something but until then suggestions are welcome.</p>
