			<p>For the majority of my life I have wanted a career in the software industry so the natural thing to do fresh out of high school was to get a degree in Computer Science. If I could talk to my eighteen-year-old self I might advise a different route. Going to school can be extremely expensive and with today&#8217;s resources seems unnecessary if you are self-motivated and passionate about achieving your goals. I&#8217;m definitely not the first person to think of this and I&#8217;m not sure I would have had the guts to do it but I thought it would be interesting to see what a completely free Computer Science curriculum would look like.</p>

<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not claiming to be an expert in Computer Science or Education, this is just similar to the curriculum I went through as a Computer Science major. Also, there are quite a few courses listed that I have not watched but were highly rated, if there is a better option out there please speak up in the comments!</em></p>

<p>h4. First year</p>

<p>The MIT course introduces Computer Science and Programming using the Python programming language.</p>

<p>&#8220;MIT: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=341597455%20</p>

<p>The first Stanford class uses Java then moves to C++ in the second one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Programming Methodology&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/programming-methodology/id384232896 &#8220;Stanford: Programming Abstractions&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/programming-abstractions/id384232917 &#8220;MIT: Single Variable Calculus&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/single-variable-calculus/id354869053 &#8220;MIT: Multivariable Calculus&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/multivariable-calculus-spring/id354869122 &#8220;MIT: Introduction to Psychology&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=341596834</p>

<p>h4. Second year</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Programming Paradigms&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=384233005%20 &#8220;Stanford: Human Computer Interaction&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id384230293 &#8220;MIT: Linear Algebra&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id384230293 &#8220;UC Berkeley: Statistics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=391540415 &#8220;Oxford: Critical Reasoning&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/critical-reasoning-for-beginners/id387875756</p>

<p>h4. Third year</p>

<p>&#8220;Stanford: Machine Learning&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/machine-learning/id384233048 &#8220;Stanford: Introduction to Robotics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/introduction-to-robotics/id384233063 &#8220;Stanford: Developing Apps for iOS&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=395631522 &#8220;Github - find or start a project to contribute to&#8221;:https://github.com/ &#8220;MIT: Physics - Classical Mechanics&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/physics-i-classical-mechanics/id341599916</p>

<p>h4. Fourth year</p>

<p>&#8220;MIT: Introduction to Algorithms&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/introduction-to-algorithms/id341597754 &#8220;Github - find or start a project to contribute to&#8221;:https://github.com/</p>

<p>h4. Finally</p>

<p>Pretty crazy that you can learn all of this while sitting at home in your pajamas. For free. It would take a lot of work and some pretty understanding parents to let you sit at home all day but I still think it&#8217;s interesting that you don&#8217;t hear about a lot of people doing this (or at least I don&#8217;t).</p>
