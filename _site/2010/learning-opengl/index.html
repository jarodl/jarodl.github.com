			<p>Since I&#8217;m in CS382 (Game development) this semester, I figured now is the time for me to finally start learning OpenGL. Sometimes the biggest problem with learning a new language/technology is the intimidation factor. Having to complete assignments for a class is a good way to overcome that. If you are not enrolled in the class, most universities have all course materials available on their web site (or iTunesU) if you look hard enough.</p>

<p>For our first program we were required to use GLUT to create a game that involved collision detection with bouncing stars. The player&#8217;s goal is to &#8216;freeze&#8217; the stars by clicking them and preventing them from colliding. While working on that assignment I attempted to wrap GLUT so I could divide portions of code up into classes easier. I&#8217;m not the first one to do this (my setup largely comes from <a href='http://paulsolt.com/2009/07/openglglut-classes-oop-and-problems/'>Paul Solt</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the code on <a href='https://github.com/jarodl/LearnOpenGL'>Github</a>. Feel free to offer any suggestions or improve upon the code. Hopefully this helps someone in the future.</p>
