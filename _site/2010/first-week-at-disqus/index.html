			<p>I arrived to San Francisco about a week ago to start my internship with <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a>. I would love to look back on this summer in the future, so I will be keeping short records of my experiences.</p>

<h4 id='living_in_san_francisco'>Living in San Francisco</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s a big change. The tech scene in this city is amazing (which is a given) and it&#8217;s a beautiful place to visit. I don&#8217;t think I would ever want to live here permanently, but it could definitely be a fun place to live in short periods. The main reason for this (for me anyway) is due to the gangs of homeless crazy people roaming the sidewalks twenty-four-seven. Even if they do yell out quotes from 300, It&#8217;s just not something I like seeing every morning and every night walking home from work.</p>

<h4 id='working_for_disqus'>Working for Disqus</h4>

<p>I knew it was going to be exciting and that I would enjoy the work, but the experience has been nothing but awesome. The work environment is really casual and the guys I work with are great. This past weekend we even went paintball&#8217;ing, which was a blast. I&#8217;m so thankful for this opportunity. When you are surrounded by cool people and are doing the things you love, it stops feeling like work and turns into pure fun.</p>

<h4 id='python_and_django'>Python and Django</h4>

<p>I have been doing Ruby and Ruby on Rails work for about a year and a half now. While my relationship with Rails is not as strong as it used to be, I still love programming in Ruby. I have been curious about Python for a long time, but never really took the time to dive into it. Since Disqus is one of the largest Django apps on the web, I had the chance to learn more about the framework this week while working on my first project. I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Working with Django was painless and the documentation is amazing. I&#8217;m really excited about learning more about both topics (and hopefully learning more JavaScript along the way, since that is also a big part of Disqus).</p>
