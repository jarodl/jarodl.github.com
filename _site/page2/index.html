				<p>I arrived to San Francisco about a week ago to start my internship with <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a>. I would love to look back on this summer in the future, so I will be keeping short records of my experiences.</p>

<h4 id='living_in_san_francisco'>Living in San Francisco</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s a big change. The tech scene in this city is amazing (which is a given) and it&#8217;s a beautiful place to visit. I don&#8217;t think I would ever want to live here permanently, but it could definitely be a fun place to live in short periods. The main reason for this (for me anyway) is due to the gangs of homeless crazy people roaming the sidewalks twenty-four-seven. Even if they do yell out quotes from 300, It&#8217;s just not something I like seeing every morning and every night walking home from work.</p>

<h4 id='working_for_disqus'>Working for Disqus</h4>

<p>I knew it was going to be exciting and that I would enjoy the work, but the experience has been nothing but awesome. The work environment is really casual and the guys I work with are great. This past weekend we even went paintball&#8217;ing, which was a blast. I&#8217;m so thankful for this opportunity. When you are surrounded by cool people and are doing the things you love, it stops feeling like work and turns into pure fun.</p>

<h4 id='python_and_django'>Python and Django</h4>

<p>I have been doing Ruby and Ruby on Rails work for about a year and a half now. While my relationship with Rails is not as strong as it used to be, I still love programming in Ruby. I have been curious about Python for a long time, but never really took the time to dive into it. Since Disqus is one of the largest Django apps on the web, I had the chance to learn more about the framework this week while working on my first project. I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Working with Django was painless and the documentation is amazing. I&#8217;m really excited about learning more about both topics (and hopefully learning more JavaScript along the way, since that is also a big part of Disqus).</p>

				<p>Today was my first day as an intern at Disqus. It was a great experience and I think I will really get along great with the people that work there. I&#8217;m excited about the first project that I was assigned and look forward to the rest of the summer.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of writing CSS. I love writing Ruby and Python, thus, Flair was born. Check out the source and more information on <a href='https://github.com/jarodl/flair'>Github</a>.</p>

<p>The very basic example of what the syntax looks like works, but the more complicated examples that will make the &#8220;language&#8221; special are currently being worked on. Right now Flair has the ability to compile the following:</p>

<pre><code>id Container:
    width = &quot;680px&quot;
    margin = &quot;2em auto&quot;

class Column:
    float = &quot;left&quot;
    width = &quot;60%&quot;
    padding = &quot;2em 0&quot;</code></pre>

<p>into this:</p>

<pre><code>#container {
  width: 680px;
  margin: 2em auto;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  width: 60%;
  padding: 2em 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see nothing special is happening right now but check out the <a href='https://github.com/jarodl/flair/blob/master/README.md'>README</a> on Github to see where I would like the project to go. While you are there go ahead and fork it!</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about doing something similar, check out Marc-Andre Cournoyer&#8217;s book <a href='http://createyourproglang.com/'>Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language</a>. The book covers the implementation of a programming language similar to Python and Ruby.</p>

				<p>Since I&#8217;m in CS382 (Game development) this semester, I figured now is the time for me to finally start learning OpenGL. Sometimes the biggest problem with learning a new language/technology is the intimidation factor. Having to complete assignments for a class is a good way to overcome that. If you are not enrolled in the class, most universities have all course materials available on their web site (or iTunesU) if you look hard enough.</p>

<p>For our first program we were required to use GLUT to create a game that involved collision detection with bouncing stars. The player&#8217;s goal is to &#8216;freeze&#8217; the stars by clicking them and preventing them from colliding. While working on that assignment I attempted to wrap GLUT so I could divide portions of code up into classes easier. I&#8217;m not the first one to do this (my setup largely comes from <a href='http://paulsolt.com/2009/07/openglglut-classes-oop-and-problems/'>Paul Solt</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the code on <a href='https://github.com/jarodl/LearnOpenGL'>Github</a>. Feel free to offer any suggestions or improve upon the code. Hopefully this helps someone in the future.</p>
