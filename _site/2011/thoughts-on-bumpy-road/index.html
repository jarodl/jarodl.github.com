			<p>Bumpy Road is a title for iOS that deserves great praise for its art direction, music and polished feel but has much more potential than the average play that it delivers. The player controls the momentum of the car by sliding his finger left and right on the screen and creating a bump. Points are awarded for how long you can keep the car filled up with fuel by collecting “gizmos” found along the road.</p>

<p>The pacing of the game is fairly strict since the screen moves at a constant rate. Once the player builds up speed he is stopped quickly by the right side of the screen. This is unfortunate because the mechanic is so much fun to use. Sliding up the piano-like tiles of the screen has a great animation and begs the player to do one fluid swipe with the expectation that this will jet the car forward. After collecting enough gizmos the screen movement does speed up and stays as long as the fuel meter stays above the half-way mark, but this is often short lived (or I’m not very good).</p>

<p>The overall visual metaphor feels conflicted with the main game mechanic. In one game mode, Sunday Drive, reaching the end of the road in the least amount of time is the main objective. Restricting the player to the speed that the screen moves feels counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Remove the speed restriction placed by controlling the screen movement and I would play this game all of the time. The game mechanic of Bumpy Road has a huge potential to create a flowing movement that gives a great sense of speed similar to games like Tiny Wings and Canabalt. With the amount of incredible work put in to the artwork, music, performance and game menus I have no doubt that it could compete well with either.</p>

<p>I would like to follow this ‘review’ up with a quote from one of my favorite movies</p>

<pre><code>in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so</code></pre>

<p>Not to say that Bumpy Road is even close to being a piece of junk. I have a great respect for anyone who creates something and puts it out in the world, so kudos to <a href='http://www.simogo.com/'>Simogo</a>, they have made something beautiful.</p>
