			<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect' title='Overjustification effect'>overjustification effect</a> is when an external incentive decreases motivation to perform a task. External incentives have been used in places like acadamia for a long time but have recently grown extremely popular in video games. It is rare to play a game that does not reward the player with some type of achievement or point system.</p>

<p>External incentives work great for tasks that are boring and unfulfilling. Few people clean or do chores because they find it rewarding and fun, they are performed out of necessity or for money. If a game is fun and enjoyable the player should not need any additional motivation. Playing a game to unlock achievements sucks out the fun.</p>

<p>Instead of meaningless rewards and points, games should focus on giving positive reinforcement and data on a player’s level of expertise. Simply telling a player ‘good job’ is a good boost of motivation without shifting the player’s focus towards obtaining a reward. Attaching points to performance data like accuracy, completion or speed is <a href='http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627' title='A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation'>detrimental</a>. Measuring competence without attaching points or rewards is enough to enhance intrisic motivation.</p>

<p>Enjoying the task at hand should be a game’s number one priority.</p>
